**NOTE** : This project is currently not functional as it was hosted for free on Heroku and Heroku shut down it's free tier.

In it's heyday it used to serve a lot of students in my college to keep track of class related matters. It had the following commands

1. Time Table : Which showed the timetable for the day
2. Notes      : Which provided noted for all classes
3. Joke       : Which queries an external API to retrieve a joke
4. Quote      : Which also queries an external API to retrieve a motivating quote
5. ktu        : Which scraped the notifications page of KTU website to get the latest news
6. Exam       : Retrieved the timetable for any upcoming exams

I also set up a structure through which anyone interested in contibuting to the bot could easily add their own commands to the bot. The code for the bot is available <a href="https://github.com/amankshihab/cslabbot">here</a>.
